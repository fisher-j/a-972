* Presented new BA increment model in meeting
* Change proportion dominant figures to include initial conditions
* Fixed [non-parametric test function] for comparing change in redwood dominance among treatments and included output.
* created composite plot: [dbh + cr]
* changed regression output tables to:
  * include: SE, P-val
  * remove: ICC
  * did this for [ht-increment model regression table] as well.
