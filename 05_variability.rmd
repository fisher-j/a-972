```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

Here are boxplots showing the variability of some potentially important variables

```{r}
p_h %>%
  filter(year == "18") %>%
  select(treatment, spp, dbh, ht, cr, inc_1, inc_2) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    !c(treatment, spp),
    names_to = "measure",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(treatment, value)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~ measure, scales = "free_y")
```
